# Fraud Detection System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes transaction data to identify fraudulent activities and protect the integrity of financial systems.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhisek34/fraud-detect-data/data). It contains transaction records with features such as transaction type, amount, source, destination, and labels indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Model Development:** Building machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment:** Deploying the trained model for real-time fraud detection in financial systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from the provided link.
2. Install the required libraries and dependencies listed in the project environment.
3. Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Develop machine learning models using algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting Machines.
6. Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
7. Deploy the trained model for real-time fraud detection.
